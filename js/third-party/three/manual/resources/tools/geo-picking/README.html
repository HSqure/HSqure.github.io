<h1 id="Geo-Picking-Data"><a href="#Geo-Picking-Data" class="headerlink" title="Geo Picking Data"></a>Geo Picking Data</h1><p>These tools were used to generate data for both<br><a href="https://threejs.org/manual/en/align-html-elements-to-3d.html">the article on aligning HTML elements to 3D</a><br>and <a href="https://threejs.org/manual/en/indexed-textures.html">the article on using indexed textures for picking and color</a></p>
<p>I’m not going to go into details on how they work but you can look inside<br>and see them draw the images and extract the data. Maybe you can use them<br>to make or extract similar maps from other data.</p>
<p>The one I actually used is <code>make-geo-picking-texture.html</code>. To run it you need<br>to download the data from <a href="http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php">here</a><br>then unzip it and put it in this folder.</p>
<p>Then run a simple server. If you don’t already know how to do that <a href="https://greggman.github.io/servez/">here’s a simple one</a><br>that will take just a few clicks to use. Run it, point it at this folder, then load <code>make-geo-picking-texture.html</code><br>in your browser.</p>
<p>There’s also another one called <code>make-geo-picking-texture-ogc.html</code>. It works with data from<br><a href="https://gadm.org/download_world.html">here</a>. To use that one download the database then use<br>a tool like <a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/">https://sqlitebrowser.org/</a>. Open the database and<br>export the table called <code>level1</code> to a json file called <code>level1.json</code></p>
<p>Then run a simple server like above and open <code>make-geo-picking-texture-ogc.html</code> in your browser.</p>
